## Max contiguous Array

logic :- just check sum at particular index and get the max of sum or current index ... eg. sum=Math.max(sum+A[index],A[index])
         now compare the global pointer with current sum.  global_max=Math.max(global_max,sum)
         
## Every element frequency is 2 only one element occures once ,find that number
  Xor of same number is 0 and xor of any number with zero is same number. java xor ^
  
## Find the number that's having the excat n/2 occurance in array
